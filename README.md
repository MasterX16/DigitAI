# DigitAI

## About
The classic digit recognition model made in python.Simply draw any digit and save it to a 28x28 pixel image and use the -f argument to provide the file.The AI will then recognise and try its best to recognise the digit.Note that the majority of the code was indeed made using the youtuber "NeuralNine" video.I added a better input layer and more training timea(epochs).

## Installation
